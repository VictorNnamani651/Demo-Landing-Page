PROJECT APPROACH & DEVELOPMENT NOTES

1. Design System First

Established a consistent color palette centered around purple/indigo gradients (#667eea, #764ba2)
Used dark backgrounds with semi-transparent overlays for depth

2. Component-by-Component Build

A. Hero Section: Animated gradient background with curved line overlays, fixed navigation with glassmorphism effect
B. Services Section: Clean cards on light background for contrast, hover effects with subtle elevation
C. Tools Section: Dark themed with background image, glassmorphism cards, horizontal layout with icons
D. Newsletter Section: Vibrant gradient with decorative circles, functional form with success feedback
E. Footer: Simplified centered layout with essential links and social icons

3. Technical Decisions

CSS animations: Used keyframes for gradient shifts and element transitions
Responsive design: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px
Performance: Fixed background attachment for parallax, backdrop-filter for modern blur effects

5. Iterative Refinement

Started with bright colors, then darkened based on feedback for better mobile viewing
Added background images to enhance visual interest
